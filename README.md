# Brief
The concept of project is to make a Desktop GUI application controlling an Arduino Uno board\
Desktop application is Java FXML application and GUI created by scene builder\
project aim is to control a DC motor\
we choose RC 4 wheel car as an application of DC motor\
arduino is connected to pc via bluetooth
User has buttons to switch motors on/off and change motor direction CW/CCW\
There is a Light/Dark mode feature which is trendy in most of application\
User has a Speed Control Slider to change PWM of motors\

GUI has 2 Gauges display RPM of motor and linear speed of rc car in m/min
